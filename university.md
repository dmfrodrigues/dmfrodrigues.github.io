This is an index of all my projects and repositories related to university modules I attended as a student.

All ‚úîÔ∏è are clickable and redirect to the corresponding repository, except for those modules with more than one project, in which case the hyperlinks are in parenthesis.
**Exercises** are repositories containing my answers/solutions to questions from tests/exams/practical classes;
**Projects** are repositories with the modules' projects that I delivered;
**Forms** are contents that lecturers let us consult during exams.

I am taking the [Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_curso_id=742&pv_ano_lectivo=2021) (3 years Bachelor + 2 years Master) at the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial). The main focuses of this course are:

1. **Software Engineering** skills and tools;
2. Knowledge of more theoretical fields like **algorithmics**, **discrete mathematics**, **number theory**, **encryption**, **distributed systems**, **compilers**, etc.
3. A solid Engineering foothold, including a decent amount of **algebra**, **calculus** and **physics** (including mechanics and electromagnetism);

Items 2. and 3. are the ones that I usually consider to distinguish an Informatics Engineer from a Software Engineer; a Software Engineer is an expert on developing software, but an Informatics Engineer is required to have the creativity to overcome harder problems, which can only be done with deep understanding of how things actually work.

On the 1st Semester of the 2nd Year of my Master, I integrated the Erasmus+ exchange program so I could study at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I integrated the [Master of Informatics](https://www.in.tum.de/en/in/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/informatics/) programme as an exchange student at the [TUM Department of Informatics](https://www.in.tum.de/en/in/cover-page/).
