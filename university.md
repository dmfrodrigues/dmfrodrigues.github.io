# FEUP

I am taking the Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering (3 years Bachelor of Engineering + 2 years Master of Engineering) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. The main focuses of this course are:

1. Software Engineering skills and tools;
2. A solid Engineering foothold, including a decent amount of algebra, calculus and physics (including mechanics and electromagnetism);
3. Knowledge of more theoretical fields like algorithmics, discrete mathematics, number theory and encryption.

Items 2. and 3. are the ones that usually distinguish a Software Engineer from an Informatics Engineer as I see it; a Software Engineer is an expert on developing software, but an Informatics Engineer is required to have the creativity to overcome hard problems, and that can only be done with deep understanding of how things actually work.

This is an index of all my projects and repositories related to FEUP curricular units as a student.
