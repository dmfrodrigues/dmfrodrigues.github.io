## Installing

### Windows

Under Windows, [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) is just fine. It basically requires you to install Ruby, and then install the two required gems `jekyll` and `bundler`.

## Deploying for the first time

## Deploying an existing repository

Just clone it, then run `bundle init`, open the file `Gemfile` that was just created, and paste

```gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```

Then run:

```cmd
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**IMP:** Since the beginning of 2021 there has been a [minor issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523) with the jekyll gem that is currently provided for Windows not working straight out-of-the-box. It shows the following error:

```

To solve it just follow the workaround in the issue, it worked just fine for me: install webrick manually by running command `bundle add webrick`.
