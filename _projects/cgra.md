A simple, single-player game where you control two-player board game where you control an airship.

- **Environment:** WebGL, Browser (Firefox/Chrome)
- **Tools:** Javascript
- **Concepts:** 3D graphics, animation, shaders, texturing

This game uses WebGL (a 3D graphics framework for browsers), which by practical experience has much better performance on Chrome/Chromium than on Firefox.

Implemented by [Diogo Rodrigues](https://github.com/dmfrodrigues) and [Breno Accioly](https://github.com/BrenoAccioly).

## Controls

- `W`/`S` to propell forward/backwards
- `A`/`D` to turn the rudders to the left/right, making the airship turn to the left/right
- `P` to turn on autopilot (flies in a circle)
- `R` to turn off autopilot (goes back to initial position with no speed)
- `L` to drop supply (up to 5 supplies)
- `↑`/`↓` to raise/lower the elevators, making the airship turn up/down
- `C` to change views:
    - Distant camera
    - Airship camera with fixed horizon
    - Airship closeup pointing forward
