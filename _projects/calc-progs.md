A set of small TI-BASIC programs I wrote for a TI-84 Plus calculator. These were my first steps in programming, starting in 2015 (10th grade). During that school year I developed increasingly complicated programs (even when I needed functions but had to use GOTO's instead) and grew more and more enthusiastic of programming and algorithmics, which eventually led me to start learning C++ in summer 2016.

- **Environment:** TI-84 Plus graphical calculator
- **Tools:** TI-BASIC
