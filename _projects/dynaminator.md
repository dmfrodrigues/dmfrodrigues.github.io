A high-performance, mesoscopic, event-driven traffic simulator. It was developed as part of my Master's thesis at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), under the [Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory](https://liacc.fe.up.pt/) (LIACC). It is an alternative to the [SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/SUMO_at_a_Glance.html) traffic simulator, that was developed with two goals in mind:
- **Peformance:** DynamiNATOR is about 27x faster than SUMO in the same scenario.
- **Control:** The type of analyses that were performed in my thesis required control over the model, so that the congestion phenomenon can be modeled in an analytically tractable way and externalities can be adequately estimated.
