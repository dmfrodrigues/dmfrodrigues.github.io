A console-based program to manage a shuttle company's daily services, focusing on the algorithmic portion of finding shortest paths and most efficient routes. This imaginary company is based on Campanhã train station (Porto, Portugal) and serves the city of Porto and other neighboring municipalities.

- **Environment:** Console
- **Tools:** C++, [GraphViewerCpp]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/graphviewercpp)
- **Concepts:** connectivity, shortest path, Dijkstra, A*, heuristics, travelling salesman problem, vehicle routing problem

This project was developed by [me](https://github.com/dmfrodrigues), [João António Sousa](https://github.com/JoaoASousa) and [Rafael Ribeiro](https://github.com/up201806330). This project was developed as part of a university subject, so we initially used the [GraphViewer](https://github.com/STEMS-group/GraphViewer) library provided by the lecturers to plot our graphs/maps. After we delivered the project in late May/2020, it still bugged me how slow the graph visualization library was, and decided to implement one myself during winter vacations in early 2021: [GraphViewerCpp]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/graphviewercpp).

Please check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dmfrodrigues/feup-cal-proj) for more details on compilation and usage.
