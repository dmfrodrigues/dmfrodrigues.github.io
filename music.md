I love music. I think it goes well with everything (especially studying, travelling, and sleeping) and is appropriate pretty much everytime. I can't really remember how much time Spotify Wrapped said I was listening to Spotify, but it was quite a lot (maybe above 100,000 minutes in 2019).

My favourite genre is metal (of any kind, but generally the heavier the better). I also like alternative/progressive rock, and my favourite band is [Muse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)), occasionally followed by [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down) although I usually prefer more artsy music. Some of the bands I also appretiate include [Paradise Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_(band)), [Trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_(band)) and [Dark Tranquility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Tranquillity).

My main music platform is Spotify (here is [my account](https://open.spotify.com/user/dmfrodrigues2000)). I occasionally use Youtube to search some songs that are otherwise not on Spotify, or to listen to nightcore radios when I'm bored. Here are the songs I have most listened to since I'm on Spotify (sorted by most times listened).
