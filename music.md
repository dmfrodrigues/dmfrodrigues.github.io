I love music. I think it goes well with everything (especially studying, travelling, and sleeping) and is appropriate pretty much everytime. I can't really remember how much time Spotify Wrapped said I was listening to Spotify, but it was quite a lot (maybe above 100,000 minutes in 2019).

My favourite genre is metal (of any kind, but generally the heavier the better). I also like alternative/progressive rock, and my favourite band is [Muse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)), occasionally followed by [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down) although I usually prefer more artsy music. Some of the bands I also appretiate include [Paradise Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_(band)), [Trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_(band)) and [Dark Tranquility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Tranquillity).

My main music platform is Spotify (here is [my account](https://open.spotify.com/user/dmfrodrigues2000)). I occasionally use Youtube to search some songs that are otherwise not on Spotify, or to listen to nightcore radios when I'm bored. Here are the songs I have most listened to since I'm on Spotify (sorted by most times listened).

        <p markdown="1">Decided to listen again to Grave Pleasures' *Motherblood* (2017). I had already added some songs, but after playing the album on repeat I found all the songs great, and ended up adding them all because they are *soo goood*. It is fairly obvious that the same rhythmic and acoustic recipe is used over the entire album, but it is still very good.</p>
        <p markdown="1">As I see it the album is a praise to death, but not as in your typical *satanic death-cult*-inspired album, nor a praise of death *per se*; it rather takes the Christian view of death as a means to reach Heaven to the extreme of wishing death on oneself to meet the afterlife as soon as possible. The flow of ideas of the album goes like this: physical existence is insanely boring ([1. *Infatuation Overkill*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr2oG9g22SQ)), so weapons of mass destruction, natural disasters and self-destructive behaviors are rejoicing for they will shorten our physical existence ([2. *Doomsday Rainbows*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iaTNzan09E), [3. *By My Hiroshima*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-OxW0KcyoQ)). A bit of death-praising later ([4. *Joy Through Death*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvdnT4esPzQ), [6. *Laughing Abyss*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STJ5BC8-gtY)), we're back to nuclear bombs ([7. *Falling for an Atom Bomb*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIUv5fddslo)) until the album climaxes at [*Atomic Christ*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEV977mWnH8), about the *"plutonium prophet of heaven"* that *"comes in mushroom clouds of fire"*, the warring messiah that will destroy all nations and end all wars. As apocalypse comes down, all that's left is terror and "dancing with the skeletons", for whoever is still alive is a dead-end for Humanity because there are no conditions for a new generation ([9. *Deadenders*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6xzm5NLMkI)). To close the album, [*Haunted Afterlife*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR79g7Ya96M) is a recognition that the afterlife is not as promised on Earth.</p>

        <p markdown="1">Also took a look at their previous album *Dreamcrash* (2015), which was apparently well received but I didn't find it particularly good, apart from *New Hip Moon*.</p>
