## Our days in Japan

We stayed at the [National Institute for School Teachers and Staff Development](https://www.nits.go.jp/en/) (NITS), some 8km north of Tsukuba. It is a large formation institute with the goal of providing in-service training to education personnel in Japan. As it had plenty of rooms for people training there during the year, in addition to all commodities required for such a stay, we were housed there for the week.

### The food

In Portugal we are very used to rice. Actually, we are the [greatest rice consumers per capita in Europe](https://landgeist.com/2022/06/25/rice-consumption-in-europe/) (around 16kg/year), followed by Spain by quite a distance. Thus it would not come as much surprise for myself to see rice as a side or main dish almost every day. As a side dish in Portugal, it is usually boiled with onion, parsley and a bit of salt.

I already had an idea about the Japanese habit of eating rice, but it didn't quite feel real until I experienced it first-hand. In Japan rice is hardly even considered a side dish, as it is practically mandatory at all meals (including breakfast), which made me realize Asians really are on another league when it comes to rice-eating. It is steamed (often with special pressure cookers), and due to its texture it becomes sticky, which makes it easier to eat with chopsticks (an instrument I have only mastered for a single meal, since I redundantly failed to use chopsticks properly on all but one occasion). Aside from that, there is nothing surprising about Japanese rice, as it has no flavor since no condiments are added (bamboo seeds may be added, but they don't add much of a flavor, and I don't really know if they are added before or after cooking though).

On the other hand, all the other parts of the diet have strong flavors, with quite a lot of fat, salt and sugar. That's exactly what the rice is for: you're supposed to mix the food with rice (preferably in your mouth rather than in the plate, that would be weird), so the rice can acquire some flavor from the food.

A particular aspect of Japanese cuisine is [*Teriyaki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriyaki) (照り焼き, 'shiny grilling'). It's a cooking technique in which food is grilled with soy sauce and sugar (the mix of soy sauce and sugar can also be referred to as teriyaki sauce), which gives it a shiny luster after cooked. From our meals at the canteen at NITS I remember chicken teriyaki was a common option. At the canteen the cooks made a certain effort to cook simple foods so we could easily choose something that was not too strange for us, but it was all Japanese food that we ate everyday, and I should say I was very surprised that the food was really good. Even more strangely, it was very good at every meal I had there during the whole stay, and I would often go back to the buffet area to get some more food.

I also got to taste [*Ebi Furai*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_shrimp#Japan) (also known as *Ebi Fry*), which consists of huge shrimps deep-fried in hot cooking oil. It is very good, and I wish I had discovered it was actually fried shrimp right at the beginning, as I ended up eating those only once.

Breakfast was particularly surprising: I was expecting at least some milk and cereals. Instead, milk was nowhere to be found, nor cereals, but instead water, tea and some of the things I would only expect to find on a meal after midday, like chicken (and rice, obviously).

There were only a few exceptions to this heavenly description.
- We ate from bento boxes (弁当, *bentō*, borrowed from Chinese, meaning 'convenient') once, and it was not the most pleasing experience, as the food was cold (as expected though), the rice tasted like plastic and the rest was mostly half-fried fish, lotus rhizomes, some sort of dumpling and some more things I still don't know to this day (oh, and a juice box with tea).

</figure>

- While in Tokyo we had little time to find a decent place to have lunch. Some of us were going for sushi, but I preferred something else so we split into two groups and I ended up having a McDonald's burger (DON'T ask for iced tea in Japan, for there is a considerable chance they'll give you a hot, regular tea instead).

As the dorms had vending machines in the ground floor, I often bought cold tea from those. There was one time I got a bottle of cold coffee before going to sleep so I could at least have coffee at room temperature in the morning; the result was rather disappointing as the coffee was obviously not warm and it was almost impalatable for it had practically no sugar (it did read 'black coffee', and when I got it from the vending machine I was more worried about the amount of caffeine rather than sugar).

### The accommodation

During my stay at NITS I had right to a small room with a bed, a desk, a drying rack and a small bathroom with one of those high-tech toilets (aka [washlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washlet)) and a sink. It wasn't much, but it was nice and comfy, and every room had air conditioning (every room and common space had its own air conditioning UNIT, not just a thermostat and an air vent), which was good since, although it was not particularly hot the rest of the days, the room walls were always pretty warm so the temperature inside the room would rise quite rapidly.

We had free WiFi all over NITS, and in some places I even had [eduroam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduroam).

However there was an important detail missing: most rooms had no showers. And since there were far less girls than boys at the IOI the rooms with showers were allocated to girls, while boys had to use the public baths (referred to as *Daiyokujō*, literally 'big bath'). And I should say it was one of the most bizarre yet surprising experiences I had abroad; I won't go into much detail as you can read more about [public baths in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sent%C5%8D), I'll just say it had around 25 seated places lined up in 4 rows and a large hot bath.

### The language

The language is probably the greatest obstacle to living and staying in Japan; not only are the Japanese known for their poor knowledge of English, but their language is quite different from European languages; not because it is particularly hard to speak, but because Japanese writings are impossible to understand, or even to copy them into a translator.

Written Japanese uses three alphabets organized into two groups. They are:

- [**Kana**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana) (仮名, 'borrowed name'), a set of two alphabets (*hiragana* and *katakana*) where each symbol is a phoneme. Symbols were borrowed and adapted from Chinese for their phonetic properties rather than their meaning, to represent Japanese words that do not have a corresponding *kanji*.
    - [**Hiragana**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) (平仮名, 'simple kana'), a set of 46 symbols plus diacritics, is the most common phonetic alphabet. Its written form is considered cursive.
    - [**Katakana**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) (片仮名, 'fragmentary kana'), a set of 48 symbols plus diacritics. They derive from small fragments of *kanji*, and are used for foreign/import words, onomatopoeias or otherwise for emphasis or to portray a foreign accent. They are characterized by straight and clear strokes, and simple shapes.
- [**Kanji**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) (漢字, 'chinese characters'), an utterly huge list of symbols, each representing an idea rather than a phoneme. They were imported from Chinese almost exactly as-is (in such a way that most kanji have almost the same meaning as the corresponding Chinese character, albeit with completely different pronunciation). Most content words are written in kanji, while kana is usually only used for small additions to the language. Kanji can have completely different pronunciation depending on context and dialect. School children are required to know 2136 [jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) (常用漢字, 'regular-use kanji') understood to be necessary for functional use of Japanese. About 3,000 kanji find common use, 4,000 find common or niche use, and the most extensive kanji list includes about 50,000 kanji, most of them with obscure meaning.

[**Rōmaji**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese) (ローマ字, 'roman characters') is the use of Latin script to write in Japanese. There are many ways to transliterate Japanese to *romaji*, but all tend to reproduce Japanese as if written in a Western language that has all the sounds there are in Japanese, for instance Portuguese (actually the earliest *romaji* systems were [based on Portuguese orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese#History), given the Portuguese were the first to arrive to Japan and to publish Japanese dictionaries in an European language, and also because Portuguese has one of the richest vowel and consonant phonologies among European languages).

They are not proper alphabets in the sense that they are better described as sets of symbols, as a sentence in Japanese is often written with a mix of symbols from different alphabets (although all Japanese sentences can be written in hiragana only, or katakana only).

The problem is exactly that they are hard to learn (because they are a lot), as well as to even read, as they are completely different from the Latin alphabet.

During my stay I used the free trial of [Yomiwa](https://www.yomiwa.net/), a Japanese dictionary, OCR and translator. With a lot of patience, it can be very useful. I found it particularly useful while trying to understand the air conditioning control unit.

I have recently discovered that the [Google Translate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en_US) app has an option allowing you to translate text in photographs (including taking a photograph and immediately getting a translation). Assuming there are more people using Google Translate than Yomiwa, the quality of the translations is probably better with Google Translate. The only feature I expected the Google Translate app to have but is not included is to detect the language in the photo; either way if you know the name of the country you're in you won't have much trouble using it.

### Cost of living and currency

The official currency in Japan is the [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (円, *en*, 'round', the Chinese term for the round silver coins arriving from [New Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain), in constrast with Chinese currency which was usually a set of complex tokens made in precious metals), represented by ¥ and has the international code JPY. A Japanese yen is worth about an euro cent (at the time €1=¥129), which was convenient because it made it easier to evaluate the actual cost of things. If ¥ is used in English, it should be written before the number (¥500), but if 円 is used instead it should be placed after the number (500円). Although ¥ is the most internationally recognized symbol and most common in other languages and platforms, the Japanese almost always use 円 in price tags, since there is no particular advantage for them to use the international symbol as the corresponding kanji takes the same space.

I found the cost of living in Japan quite affordable when compared to Portugal; the prices are actually quite similar. Of course products were a bit more expensive in Tokyo than in Tsukuba, but they were still affordable and prices in Tokyo were just 10-20% higher than in Tsukuba for food and other goods (if we were talking about housing or salaries that'd be a whole different story).

There was one particularity I noticed in Japanese currency: all coins are relatively 'normal', except for one small copper coin: it has a hole and bears no value in arabic numerals. Yu-san then explained us they're worth ¥5, and since they're called 五円 (*go en*, 'five yen') which sounds similar to 御縁 (*go-en*, 'spiritual connection') they're usually kept in wallets or thrown in shrines for good luck and prosperity by establishing a good connection with spirits. She additionally told us that ¥50 coins, called 五十円 (*gojū-en*, 'fifty yen'), are also considered by some to give good luck due to similarities with the 5¥ coin (similar name, and the hole).

### The earthquakes and typhoons

On the eve of the second day of the competition (4 Sep), we were warned [typhoon Jebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Jebi_(2018)) had hit land near [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka), traveled to [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto) and would affect Ibaraki prefecture from 4 Sep afternoon to 5 Sep morning. There were reports of extensive damage in the [Kansai region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region), and [Kansai International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_International_Airport) was closed that day due to serious inundation, large waves (Kansai Int'l is located on an island), rain damage in the terminals and an incident where strong winds [drove a tanker into the bridge connecting the airport to the mainland](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190928/p2a/00m/0na/003000c).

It was not much to worry as the constructions at NITS were pretty solid, but the trees shook quite a lot during the afternoon, and I experienced the strongest winds in my life, capable of dragging a standing person. I definitely don't live in a hurricane/typhoon area; on the other hand the Pacific has a typhoon season every **year**.

</figure>

During the night the rain and strong winds didn't bother me much. I woke up around 5am for no special reason, so I tried to go to sleep again. At Sep 5, 5:11 ([Sep 4, 20:11 UTC](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us2000h8dj/executive)), the earth started shaking. Quite violently. I was so scared I crawled under the desk from my bed, and started counting. The earth shook for 15 seconds, and then it all stopped, it went as rapidly as it came. I stayed some more time under the desk, then got out of my room to check what was happening in the corridor; not a single sound, absolute silence as before. Needless to say I didn't sleep the rest of the night.

In Portugal, as in most Western countries, earthquakes are but a curiosity. I remembering being at home, some 5 or so years ago, and hearing a distant roar in the middle of the afternoon. When I went to [IPMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Portugu%C3%AAs_do_Mar_e_da_Atmosfera) website there was in fact an earthquake entry of a low-magnitude earthquake at around that time. In my 12th grade, I was in the middle of a Math class in the morning when the earth shook a little, and we heard something like the buzz of a construction equipment. Later that afternoon, there it was in IPMA. But all below magnitude 3.0, barely noticeable.

The next day (5 Sep) I checked the news, but there was barely any trace of what happened that morning. Only a [brief notification](https://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/05/c_137445551.htm) by the Chinese state-run press agency, and the [USGS report](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us2000h8dj/executive)). Just another day at the office for the Japanese. The earthquake had magnitude 5.4, and originated from a mere 60km off the coast of Ibaraki prefecture. It was only felt in Ibaraki prefecture, and it had an intensity of IV in Tsukuba.

The next night, another earthquake happened, this time at 6 Sep 3:08. I was about to go to sleep as the shaking started. It was clearly less intense, and since I already knew what was going on I just stayed laid in my bed, feeling it shaking a bit. This second time was a curious experience, it was just unfortunate to know the next day that it was so intense it had its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hokkaido_Eastern_Iburi_earthquake). It had magnitude 6.6, and happened in the southern coastal sub-prefecture of [Iburi, Hokkaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iburi_Subprefecture), about 30km below ground. It caused several service disruptions and landslides in Hokkaido, killing 41, injuring 691 and causing power outages for 5.3M people. The total damage was estimated to be at least 367.5 billion yen (2.85 billion €, about 1.4% of the Portuguese GDP, which means we are just one or two degrees of magnitude below the scale of what a country produces in a year).

A fun fact for some, an inconvenience and a tragic event for others.

### The competition

During the second part of the competition, I had to use the toilet. First of all, the queue was so long I had to wait for about 15min for an empty toilet in the middle of the competition. Secondly, as my time finally came I just entered the first empty toilet, only to find it was a [squat toilet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_toilet), a first to me. It is however paradigmatic how a society obsessed with hygiene and [washlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washlet), the most technologically and functionally advanced Western-style toilets, can coexist with apparently traditional squat toilets.
