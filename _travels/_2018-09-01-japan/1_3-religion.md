### Religion

There are two main [religions in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Japan):

- [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto), the traditional Japanese religion.
- [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan), imported from Korea in the 6th century.

These two religions have coexisted peacefully in Japan, to a point many people practice both Shinto and Buddhism simultaneously (69% practice Shintoism and 67% practice Buddhism), and even Emperors (which are also the supreme leaders of Shinto) practiced some forms of Buddhism. Religion in Japan is confusing, since many people do not identify themselves as Shinto nor Buddhist (because their beliefs are influenced by both, or because they are not part of any specific religious organization or cult/sect) although they continue worshiping in temples, and some worship Shinto deities in Buddhist temples and vice-versa.

As you probably have already heard of Buddhism before, I'm going to skip that part, and go straight into Shinto.

#### Shinto

[Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) is the indigenous religion of Japan. It is a polytheistic religion, made of a diverse (and rather loose) set of traditional Japanese beliefs, with two main aspects:
- **Naturalism**: the natural world is a manifestation of divinity, and as such the elements that make up nature must be respected.
- **Spirits**: *kami* (ç¥ž, 'gods/spirits') are elements of the landscape, forces of nature, beings or qualities expressed by beings, as well as the spirits of venerated dead people. They represent positive or negative attributes, and people should strive to nurture the positive attributes represented by kami. Shrines are dedicated to specific kami, and a shrine dedicated to a certain kami is the appropriate place to worship that kami, although smaller or personal shrines can also be built. Kami are not intrinsically metaphysical beings, as they can often live in, and interfere with, the physical world.

Shinto was the official religion of Japan for a long time, and its history is deeply entangled with Japanese history; Japanese emperors are often enshrined as kami, and the first Japanese leader, [Emperor Jimmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Jimmu), is traditionally said to be a descendant of Shinto sun goddess [Amaterasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu)).
