### Returning

We first took the [Yamanote Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) <img class="inline" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/JR_JY_line_symbol.svg"> from [Shibuya Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Station) to [Akihabara Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara_Station), and then the [Tsukuba Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Express) <img class="inline" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Tsukuba_Express_mark.svg"> to [Tsukuba Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Station).

Our travel back to Tsukuba could have been whatever you'd expect from a suburban train at 20:30 during the week: relatively calm and empty. It wasn't, as there was an impressive amount of white-collars, and if it was already quite crammed at the beginning people just started pilling up inside the train for a couple more stations. It eventually calmed down a bit, but we only got seats maybe two stops before the end of the line. It is unusual the amount of people still getting out of work at 8PM.

Somewhat prophetically, Prof. Pedro Ribeiro gave a cookie to each of us four students, "in case you can't find any open restaurants to have dinner". I kinda laughed it out, but there was one minor detail we had missed all along: NITS had a curfew hour at 22:00. And this is not just any curfew; although the gates remained open and the dorm entries unlocked during the night, we were not allowed out of the dorms as we were considered minors in Japan and the IOI organization could pretty much do whatever they wanted with us (in Japan the age of majority was 20 years at the time, so although I was 18 years old and as thus considered an adult in Portugal, I was still a child in Japan). That was just before we caught the bus (this time we had a little help in getting into the right bus, although with similar levels of doubt).

### Back at NITS

We arrived at NITS at around a quarter to 10PM, and left the dorms at around ten past 10PM; we were obviously surprised when we stumbled across an IOI vigilant as we were getting out of the elevator. We didn't even know there was a curfew, let aside that it was being heavily enforced. The old man obviously took the chance to belittle us for having such a "childish behavior" in trying to leave NITS during curfew, although he was the one acting childishly as Japan is a very safe country and we could perfectly handle ourselves around and find our way back to NITS (after all we had just caught a bus from Tsukuba by our own without understanding a thing of Japanese or Tsuku-Bus schedules, and not even Google Maps knew Tsuku-Bus existed; plus we had already walked multiple times during the evening from NITS to the small settlement of Tsukuho, even using cellphone flashlights given the weak street lighting around NITS). Such an attitude of his could only mean this was just a way for him to vent out whatever problems he was having that had nothing to do with four young, respectful lads looking for somewhere to eat. We weren't that hungry though, it was mostly a matter of habit of having dinner.

We were forced to abide, as we would be probably disqualified if we didn't. So I got myself another bottle of cold tea, and ate that sad little cookie (and some other cookies I had brought myself from Portugal).

This reminds me of a comment Yu-san made, on the afternoon of the day we arrived of Japan. She mentioned we seemed "more grown-up" than our Japanese equivalents; I was not quite sure what she meant (if physically for being taller and having beard, or mentally), but in the light of the previous incident I can probably say both. Several facts lead me to think the Japanese youth are in some sort *infantilized* by [their language](https://japaneseruleof7.com/are-japanese-people-retarded/) which is so utterly hard they learn it up to highschool (it is hard to focus on texts with content if you can't understand the words), and by the Japanese pop culture (mostly manga and anime), which is supposed to generally target teenagers and young adults but ends up being consumed by older lads (which in some way delays critical thought), where the content is usually simple and most often visual. Not that the Japanese are "stupid" in all areas, as their mandatory school programmes in sciences are often more demanding than Western countries', but literature and philosophy (which are the subjects that help young people gain more maturity of thought) is often not cultivated by their education system, which is almost absolutely based in memory instead of reasoning.
