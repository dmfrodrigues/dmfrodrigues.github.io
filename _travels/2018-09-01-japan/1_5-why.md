### Why

On the 7 May 2018 I ranked 8th in the Portuguese [National Olympiad in Informatics](http://oni.dcc.fc.up.pt/2018/) (Olimpíadas Nacionais de Informática - ONI), so I had access to the selection stage for the [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/) (IOI). In the selection test I ranked 4th, and had a global classification (ONI finals + selection test) that ranked me 4th, meaning I was one of the four lucky to attend the [IOI2018](https://ioi2018.jp/), from 1 to 8 September in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan, as a proud representative of Portugal.

### With whom

We were 4 students:
- Myself, from Porto
- André Nascimento, from Lisbon
- David Nassauer, from Lisbon
- Kevin Pucci, from Chaves

We were accompanied by two 'teachers', both former competitors:
- Leader Pedro Ribeiro (teacher @FCUP, organizer of ONI)
- Deputy leader Pedro Paredes (PhD student @CMU)
