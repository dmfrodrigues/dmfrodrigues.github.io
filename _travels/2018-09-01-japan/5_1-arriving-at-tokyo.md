## In Tokyo

On Thursday 6/Sep we were supposed to go on an excursion to visit some coastal towns in Ibaraki prefecture. It could certainly be an interesting excursion, but rather lame when compared to the possibility of spending a whole day in Tokyo.

And so we did.

#### Bus trip

The plan was to leave NITS in the morning, and somehow travel the 8km to [Tsukuba Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Station) to meet the teachers. The day before we scouted the area, to try and find a bus stop where we could catch any bus to Tsukuba. We eventually found one, quite small and seemingly abandoned, but we still decided to stick with it.

So, the next day we went to that bus stop, and waited for about 15min for any bus to pass, but nothing happened. As we were starting to find the whole situation a bit strange, a random citizen was walking by, a short middle-aged man in a shirt, with a black backpack and in some hurry. We decided to ask him (in English) where the nearest bus stop was to catch a bus to Tsukuba, and he kindly tried to explain it to us, in some sort of very broken English. As we were nowhere near understanding him, we tried to use a map we had gotten from a hotel where we had already asked for directions the day before, but before I could pull the map out this man opened his backpack, got an open envelope and a pen and *drew* the map of the area in the back of the envelope, literally in the middle of the street. If there is any better example of how kind the Japanese are, I can't think of a better one.

#### The bus terminal

We eventually found something that looked like a bus terminal; I later came to know it was the [Tsukuba City Hall Oho Branch Office](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B0%E5%B8%82+%E5%A4%A7%E7%A9%82%E7%AA%93%E5%8F%A3%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC/@36.1359841,140.0808189,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6022092250c00001:0x10216d3fcee278be!8m2!3d36.1360714!4d140.0824025?hl=en). As we got there we faced another obstacle: all the information relative to the buses was in Japanese, so we could not even read the time tables (we asked another person waiting for the bus if there was any going to Tsukuba), nor the digital displays on the side of the buses, which presumably indicated the destination. On the first bus that stopped there, we asked a passenger if the bus was going to Tsukuba; the answer was affirmative, but we were not very convinced if he actually understood our question. We would either way find that out, one way or another.

We took a bus from the [Tsuku-Bus]( https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8F%E3%83%90%E3%82%B9) Northern Bus, connecting Mount Tsukuba to the city center (¥200).

#### The railroad system

Before going into details, let me just mention the Japanese railroads and metro system are highly efficient and quite comfortable. First of all, there is some sort of distinction between train and metro, but both are underground in Tokyo, and quite similar in operation and trains. Besides, all train stations had restricted access, and to travel we used cards charged with money which was reduced every time we travelled (similar to [Viva Viagem cards](https://www.metrolisboa.pt/en/buy/viva-viagem-card/) in Lisbon, or the [Oyster cards](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/pay-as-you-go/oyster-pay-as-you-go) in London). I believe I charged the card twice, with a total of about ¥3000. Each individual trip was relatively inexpensive, but given the size of Tokyo we frequently needed to travel by train/metro, so I ended up spending almost all the money I had charged. Finally, there was not a single time I had to wait for more than 2-3min for a train/metro.

Resuming: we eventually arrived at the Tsukuba Station, where we met our teachers. We bought and charged our cards, and then took the [Tsukuba Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Express) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Tsukuba_Express_mark.svg" class="inline"> to [Akihabara Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara_Station) (¥1,205).

As it was an hour or two past peak morning time, we got ourselves some seats on the train, which took around an hour to travel the 60km separating Tsukuba from Akihabara, Tokyo. The train was quite fast actually.

#### The cars

As we were traveling quite fast I also got a chance of having a better general perspective on something I had already noticed: that the cars used by the Japanese tend to be smaller and utilitarian than they look pretty (that is to say Japanese cars are small and ugly). Apparently the Japanese don't have a great taste for cars, and they rather prefer small cars that suit their needs: small vans or cars that are cheap and easy to park. I also saw several vertical iron parking lots, quite an unusual sight for people like me that don't live anywhere near a huge, densely-packed metropolis.

#### The suburban cityscape

One typical feature of the Japanese suburb is that almost all cables are placed overhead, to such an extent [streets are infested with cables and cable poles](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/why-does-japan-have-so-many-overhead-power-lines). It is mostly a cultural thing, but arguments in favor of overhead cables claim they are cheaper, can be more easily maintained and repaired, and are faster to establish after landslides.

That day was a bit cloudy and misty (there was light rain twice that day). As we started approaching Tokyo, the landscape progressively changed from rice fields into a few houses, then to huge plains of two-story houses, then growing buildings. It was quite a remarkable sight, a demonstration of how many we humans really are and the extent people go to have affordable and comfortable housing. Finally, in the distance, the huge [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree) (tallest tower in the world) started appearing from the light mist: we were finally entering Tokyo, the greatest metropolis on the surface of Earth.
