## Leaving

We arranged for bus transportation to [Narita International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita_International_Airport) with the IOI organization, so we were picked up at NITS at around 6:30 and driven to the airport.

### At the airport

Since the Portuguese were the first Europeans to contact with the Japanese, it is understandable why so many parts of Japanese cuisine were influenced by the Portuguese. Some of the most well-known flags of Japanese cuisine had their origins in Portugal:
- [Tempura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempura) (天ぷら or 天麩羅, *tenpura*) refers to any food (generally seafood, meat or vegetables) that has been battered and deep-fried. In Japan deep-fried food was traditionally simply fried, or battered with rice flour, so the sight of food fried after battered with flour and eggs was news to the Japanese. Its name comes from the [ember days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_days), the four yearly fastings of Catholics during the Middle Ages, called *Quattuor Tempora* ('four seasons') in Latin.
- [Castella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castella) (カステラ, *kasutera*), the traditional Japanese sponge cake. It is inspired from the Portuguese [*pão de ló*](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A3o_de_l%C3%B3), also known as *pão de Castela*; although Portuguese pão de ló is an expensive product, Japanese castella seems to be much more of a premium food.
- [Konpeitō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konpeit%C5%8D) (金平糖 or コンペイトー) is a type of small sugar candy which come in a variety of colors. They originate from the Portuguese [*confeito*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfit).

At the duty-free zone I did have my first look at Castella. As a brief note, in Portugal a good *pão de ló* costs €15-20/kg, so you can see *castella* is a premium in Japan when a box with clearly less than a kilogram costs ¥3,000 (€23.26), quite expensive even for a duty-free shop.

### On our way back

On our way back we took two flights on [Japan Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines) <img class="inline" src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Japan_Airlines_JAL_logo.png">, both operated by [Finnair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair) <img class="inline" src="https://airhex.com/images/airline-logos/finnair.png">.

Last time we basically took a connecting flight from Lisbon to Madrid, and then took a single, very long flight. This time we left [Narita Int'l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita_International_Airport) at 09:50 (GMT+09:00), and arrived 10h later in [Helsinki Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Airport), at 13:50 (GMT+03:00). Since we had some four hours and a half until the next flight, we decided to give Helsinki a try (you can check my notes on my short stay in Helsinki [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/travels/2018-sep-finland/)).

We then took at 18:20 (GMT+03:00) a short 4h50min flight from [Helsinki Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Airport) to [Lisbon Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Airport), where we arrived at 21:10 (GMT+01:00), thus putting an end to our adventure (I still had to drive for about 4h back to my hometown near Porto).
