#### Akihabara

We then arrived at Akihabara station, one of the most famous and busiest train stations in the world. Its fame is owned to the neighbourhood surrounding it, unofficially called Akihabara (or otherwise shortened to Akiba) after the station. It started as a center for household appliances of all sorts and sizes (TVs, vacuum cleaners, pianos, headsets, you name it), and eventually became the capital of Japanese pop culture (games, music, anime/manga, assembly kits, plushes, maid cafés, etc.).

As soon as I set foot outside the train station (through the Main Gate North Exit), I was amazed at the sea of tall buildings. We didn't lose much time and entered the first shopping centre we found, Yodobashi-Akiba. It is the largest shopping centre in Akihabara, with a huge area and seven-story high. It is one of a series of shopping centres managed by electronics retailer [Yodobashi Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodobashi_Camera).

</div>

The shopping centre was so large we had to get some maps to find our way through it. Each floor was dedicated to a certain sort of appliances/products and had multiple counters spread throughout. You can easily get a closer insight on what it looks like, as it is a common attraction for adventurers looking for Youtube fame.

We then crossed the street to the most iconic spot of Akihabara, informally known as Akihabara Crossing, formed by the intersection of the main commercial street with the street leading to the train station.

</div>

For starters, we entered in the SEGA building. It's called SEGA Akihabara Building 3. Actually SEGA has five huge buildings in Akihabara only, serving either as arcades or shops. From the ground floor one could confuse it for a simple game store, however it is only you take the escallator that you realise all the floors from the first to the top are 100% arcade machines. It was a mixed experience, as the sight was impressive, as is the way SEGA still holds on, even with arcade games; on the other side, it was almost depressing to say the least, as some of the people there seemed to live in the arcade judgind by the frenetic way they played.

We went on for a bit, until the end of that area, just before crossing the [Kanda River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanda_River).

Because some of us wanted to have sushi and other didn't (including myself), we split into two groups. Now in a smaller group, we turned left to reenter Akihabara Station via the Electric Town South Exit to proceed to our next destination.

#### Pachinko

As a side note, on the left photo there is a sign reading "APPLE. & PACHINKO", which takes us to an interesting part of Japanese contemporary culture: [Pachinko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko) (パチンコ). It is a mechanical game similar to pinball, but often without flippers which makes it more of a slot machine. The player introduces a metal ball in the playing field, and then hopes the ball falls into a hole that will award him as many balls as possible. Gambling is illegal in Japan, so Pachinko parlors use the following scheme to exploit a legal loophole:

1. The balls are the active element of the game, but they are also the bet (you rent balls for cash) and the prize (to 'win' is to have as many balls as possible).
2. The balls cannot be taken out of the parlor nor exchanged for money (which is illegal), but they can be exchanged for tokens, or 'special prizes' (which is legal).
3. These tokens can in turn be taken out of the parlor and (legally) exchanged for a certain sum in specialized shops (which are ostensively independent of, but often owned by, Pachinko parlor owners).

Gambling is a ravaging epidemic within Japanese society, which may be explained by the pressure to have success taken to such a level that some are led by an obcessive, short-sighted pursuit of success and persistently bet in games of chance.

- On one side, the corporates and Pachinko parlor owners: in 1999, Pachinko revenues and sales represented 5.6% of Japan's GDP, and as of 2015 it generated more revenue than gambling in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore **together**;
- On the other, the people: in 2014, 9.04% of men and 1.6% of women in Japan showed pathological gambling tendencies (by comparison, the USA has 1.6% globally), and in 1999 a 29% of Pachinko players addmited to have a gambling addiction, and 30% admitted to go over their budgets and borrowed amounts.

#### Ochanomizu

We entered Akihabara to catch a commuter train from the [Chūō-Sōbu Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D%E2%80%93S%C5%8Dbu_Line) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/JR_JB_line_symbol.svg" class="inline">, for a short ride (2min) to [Ochanomizu Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu_Station). Not before I had a first glance of a classical from Japan: all [white-collar workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker) literally wear [dress shirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt) everyday to work. And in nowadays Tokyo they are the majority, meaning the city is filled with "penguins" from 9am to 6pm.

At [Ochanomizu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu) we didn't see anything special, as we were not really planning to do anything there, since we were only changing trains. The station has two parts, separated by the [Kanda River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanda_River) (which we had to cross through the [Ochanomizu Bridge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ochanomizu+Bridge/@35.6997827,139.7639489,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x60188db932ebcec3:0xd70d7986ecc0e1f1!2sHijiribashi!8m2!3d35.6997086!4d139.7655652!3m4!1s0x60188c19c406cc45:0xf5c74cb6d4d1418f!8m2!3d35.7002221!4d139.7635958?hl=en)):
- [JR East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu_Station#JR_East) to the southeast (south of the river), serving trains;
- [Tokyo Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu_Station#Tokyo_Metro) to the north of the river, serving metros.

So we went to Ochanomizu Tokyo Metro, and headed to [Kōrakuen Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Drakuen_Station), in the central part of [Bunkyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunky%C5%8D), using the [Marunouchi Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Marunouchi_Line) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Logo_of_Tokyo_Metro_Marunouchi_Line.svg" class="inline">.

#### Bunkyō

[Bunkyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunky%C5%8D) is one of Tokyo's [special wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo). It is a residential and educational center, known for its numerous universities, parks and other spaces built for residents. Some important companies also have headquarters in Bunkyō, although the ward can not exactly be considered a business center.

After exiting [Kōrakuen Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Drakuen_Station), we started by visiting the main attraction: the [Bunkyo Civic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkyo_Civic_Center), a 28-storey, 146m-tall building, serving as the government building for Bunkyo ward. It is most well-known for having a **free** observation deck (and we didn't have to take the stairs), from which you can easily see [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) on a clear day.

[**Mount Fuji**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) is the highest mountain in Japan, with 3776m. It is located in the eastern parts of Chubu, and can be seen from many places, especially in the [Kanto Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_Plain) (it is clearly visible from several locations in Tokyo, even though Tokyo is 60km to the northeast of Mount Fuji). It is an active stractovolcano, and it last erupted in 1708.   Its almost perfectly symmetrical shape, associated to the fact it is easily visible from Tokyo, the capital of Japan since 1600, prompted its numerous appearances in Japanese art, culture and folklore.

At the the [Bunkyo Civic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkyo_Civic_Center) we took the elevator (which was surprisingly fast yet confortable), mixed with the local government staff. The elevator stopped twice, and both times we saw huge open offices full of white-collars. We could have literally wandered around the offices, in a certain way a physical demonstration of what transparency should look like in local and public administration.

The view was quite great, altough I was a bit disappointed as I could not see [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji), as I even brough my binoculars. In Tokyo it was only partly cloudy, but apparently it was misty around [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) so we couldn't see much in the distance.

As we left the civic center, we passed by the [Tokyo Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome). is a baseball stadium, home to the [Yomiuri Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomiuri_Giants), the current title winner and the team with most [Central League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_League) titles. The stadium is so large it is often used in Japan to compare large sizes, and it is also often used for other events, most notably concerts.

Adjacent to the stadium is the [Tokyo Dome City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome_City), an entertainment complex including an amusement park, a hoteland several other commerce shops. The weather was starting to heat up so we stayed in the Tokyo Dome City for a while since it had a fountain lake with water sprayers (so the air would be cooler even though it was an open-air area), but also because Prof. Pedro Ribeiro decided to have his way with the [Thunder Dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Dolphin) rollercoaster.

We then had lunch at Koraku McDonald's (the place you're most likely to be understood in English, and even so Kevin got a regular, hot tea instead of an iced tea), and then crossed the Suidōbashi bridge over the Kanda River to catch the train at [Suidōbashi Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suid%C5%8Dbashi_Station) to get to our next destination.
