### History

#### Ancient epoch (until 538)

The archipelago has been inhabited for about 32,000 years; there is a consensus that the early man arrived using watercraft, in a time where inferior sea levels made Japan closer to Korea. The various tribes of Japan progressively coalesced into a set of kingdoms, eventually unified into a single kingdom of Japan in the [Kofun Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun_period), under the rule of the emperors of the [Yamato state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_period) (today’s Japanese imperial lineage). This unification allowed China to recognize Japan as a state, and a more effective transfer of technical and administrative knowledge from the mainland to the archipelago.

#### Classical epoch (538-1185)

This epoch started with the introduction of Buddhism in Japan from Korea. During this period, Japanese culture was extensively developed. Several students and government members traveled to China to learn the principles of administration and the bureaucratic state, as well as the new ideas on religion, philosophy and politics. Major political reforms were put into place, through the nationalization and redistribution of lands to farmers according to [Confucianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism) ideas. However, by the end of this era, the imperial court was so absorbed with internal intrigues, power struggles and the artistic pursuits of court nobles that it neglected the administration of the kingdom outside the capital. That generated a power vacuum which was filled by small feudal lords that progressively acquired lands and tax exemptions, and amassed large armies and numerous [samurais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai), which were highly-skilled generals and swordsmen. By the end of this epoch, Japan was *de facto* controlled by the [Minamoto clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamoto_clan).

#### Feudal epoch (1185-1600)

As military feudal lords grew increasingly important, they started governing their own lands. A feudal leader was called a [shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun) (将軍, *shōgun*, ‘army commander’), and the lands under his control was called a *shogunate*. During feudal Japan, violent power struggles were common between different shogunates.

It was also in this epoch, in 1543, that the Portuguese arrived at [Tanegashima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima), the first Europeans to set foot in Japan. There was always a fragile balance between the will of the Japanese to trade and learn from the Portuguese, but also an effort to limit foreign influence by limiting trade, and to maintain public order by prohibiting the Jesuits from preaching Christianity and converting the Japanese in land outside Portuguese colonies. To trade with Japan and organize their Far East activities, the Portuguese were given the city of [Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki), which saw great development from a small fishing village into a major trade hub.

The last period of this epoch was the [Sengoku period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period) (戦国時代, *Sengoku Jidai*, ‘Age of Warring States’), from 1467 to 1615, a period of intrigue, social upheaval and permanent civil war, which greatly benefited Portugal and Spain, since there was great interest by some shoguns to ally with, and learn from, the European powers.

By the end of this period, Japan was mostly reunited under two major shoguns, [Oda Nobunaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga) and [Toyotomi Hideyoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi).

#### Early Modern epoch (1600-1868)

The early modern epoch starts with the unification of Japan under [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu), a former ally of [Toyotomi Hideyoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi). This reunification brought a long period of peace and stability under strict control of the military government of the [Tokugawa shogunate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate), lasting for 268 years, where the Emperor had very limited powers. This epoch was also marked by the almost-complete isolation of Japan from the rest of the world, known as [Sakoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku) (鎖国, ‘closed country’), with the objective of maintaining stability by severing all communications with China and the colonial powers, and thus avoid foreign meddling with Japanese affairs.

By the end of this period, the Tokugawa shogunate was becoming increasingly weaker, due to the inception of Western culture and science into Japan, as well as the [Perry Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Expedition) (1853-1854), an American show of strength to force Japan into opening for trade with Western powers.

Seeing these events as a chance to restore supreme power to the Emperor, the imperial court allied with the Western powers to bring down the Tokugawa Shogunate. The imperial court fought and defeated the Tokugawa Shogunate using overwhelmingly superior technology in the [Boshin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boshin_War) (1868-1869), concluding the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration) by returning effective power to the Emperor, and starting the [Meiji era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)).

#### Modern epoch (1868-)

Japan saw a huge technical and economic progress in the [Meiji era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)) (reigning period of [Emperor Meiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Meiji)). Until 1926, Japan adopted a fast and steady rate in implementing economic reforms, modernization and democratization. However, starting with [Emperor Hirohito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito), Japan saw the rise of extreme nationalism and Japanese imperialism, laying claims and invading Korea, China and several other overseas dominions, giving the conquered peoples the worst treatments. These attitudes caused a series of events that eventually led Japan to join the Axis during [World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The participation of Japan in WW2 was ended by the infamous [atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki).

Strangely it did not even come to my mind the idea of asking about recent Japanese history during my stay (possibly because the Japanese society has evolved to hide that chapter under the carpet); however, and although I know very well I would probably hurt whoever I was talking to, I regret not asking an actual Japanese person about it, which would certainly be in a privileged position to explain what happened and why under a different perspective.

After the war, Japan experienced the well-known [economic miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_economic_miracle) until the 1990s, boosted by a huge, rapidly increasing, educated workforce and a strong will to resurrect the Japanese economy in the aftermath of WW2, with the help of the United States. Japan rapidly became a center of technology, exporting mostly home appliances and robots.
