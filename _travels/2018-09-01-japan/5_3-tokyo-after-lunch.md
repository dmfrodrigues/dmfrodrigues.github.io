#### Takeshita Street

We took the [Chūō Line (Rapid)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D_Line_(Rapid)) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/JR_JC_line_symbol.svg" class="inline"> to [Yoyogi Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyogi_Station), and then the [Yamanote Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/JR_JY_line_symbol.svg" class="inline"> to [Harajuku Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku_Station), in the [Harajuku district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku). This district is known for being a center of youth culture (in some cases alternative culture and counter-culture).

We started by visiting [Takeshita Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshita_Street), a narrow pedestrian street with all kinds of shops, restaurants and boutiques. It has some well-known shops, but most are independent businesses with varying styles. It was known in the 1990's as a reliable place to purchase counterfeit Japanese and American brand goods; similarly for [Loureiro Street](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rua_do_Loureiro) in Porto, which was known for its many electronics shops and counterfeit quality products.

I didn't see anything particular, aside from the fact the street is a bit narrow and quite lower then the more recent roads that connect to it. I also noticed a sort of a Japanese punk taking care of a small shop (tattoos perhaps, I'll never know), throwing strange looks at passers-by.

We met the sushi group at Takeshita street. They had arrived earlier so while we were checking on the shops the sushi group decided to have some [bubble tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea). I can't recall precisely the details, but in broad terms I remember they told us they were guided by an old man from Takeshita street into some adjacent narrow alleys, had to go through multiple staircases and some gates, and finally arrived at some undergroud sort of café. Who would've thought it would be necessary to use means that slightly surpass those of shady businesses just to get some bubble tea.

Either way while we were waiting I got myself some icecream, after which I had the brilliant idea of going down the street and try to enter this large park with my icecream. Not only was it not just a park (it was *the* Meiji Shrine, one of the most important temples of the *de facto* religion of Japan), but I was barred by a policeman from entering it as soon as I crossed the road. Honestly I hadn't even noticed the policeman, and when I did I didn't realise he was talking to me at first. As he realised I was (obviously) not Japanese he said in some sort of broken english that it was forbidden to eat inside the Shrine (I am of course familiar with the fact one must not eat, and preferrably not drink either, in places of cult, but that usually only applies to closed spaces, so it would be natural to assume I could bring my icecream inside the shrine, as long as it was outdoors and I didn't drop it). Either way we had a seat at a café right in front of the shrine gate.

Only recently I noticed the very own bridge I (and my icecream) crossed was itself somewhat of an attraction: [Jingu Bashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingu_Bashi) (神宮橋, 'Shrine Bridge') is a hotspot for cosplaying given its central position in [Harajuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku).

#### Meiji Shrine

The [Meiji Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine) is the Shinto shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of [Emperor Meiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Meiji) and [his wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Sh%C5%8Dken). It was built after the Emperor's death to commemorate his role in the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration), and until 1946 it was in the first rank of government-supported shrines. It is the most popular shrine in Japan for [hatsumōde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde), the first Shinto shrine visit of the [Japanese New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_New_Year), where people pray/wish for a good new year.

</div>

We entered the shrine via the southeast entry (the first [Torii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii) gate of the shrine, which is also the largest wooden torii in the world), and took a curve to left and then to the right to enter the central part of the shrine using the southern inner gate. In the way we found two very particular structures, one with sake vessels, and other with large wine barrels with golden plates mostly engraved with French names; these were donations of sake and Burgundy wine to the shrine.

</div>

On approaching the inner gate there was a small water fountain, to wash our hands before entering the central part of the shrine. Inside the shrine the northern side housed the main praying and offerings area, which we were asked not to photograph by shrine guards. Aside from that, there was a prayers tree, with a large wooden structure around it to strap small wood tables with prayers. This sort of prayers are often collected and burnt so the gods listen to them.

#### Sendagaya

[Sendagaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendagaya) is an area of [Shibuya ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo), to the northwest of the Meiji Shrine. It is mostly characterized by its vast green spaces and its narrow residential and commercial streets. A sort of a suburban oasis of tranquility in the middle of the metropolis.

</div>

We left the Meiji Shrine through the north gate, near the Harajuku Fire Station Branch (or otherwise at [Kita-sando Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kita-sando_Station) entrance 3). We were headed to [Yoyogi Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyogi_Station), but we decided to made a short detour to try and enter the [Shinjuku Gyo-en National Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Gyo-en). Unfortunately it was already closed; a real shame we couldn't visit as it is a beautiful garden, a true escape from the bustling life of Tokyo.

On the other hand I was quite amused to find a vending machine in a residential street adjacent to the garden entry. And it did not sell just any drinks: it had [Dr Pepper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper), one of the mythical soft drinks. I was quite curious to taste it, as it is one of those American products that really sticked in some parts of Japan (and a common appearance in [Steins;Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate)), so I got a 75ml bottle of Dr Pepper for ¥120. It had such an unimaginable amount of sugar I almost couldn't finish it (even for a 7up appreciator like myself, criticized by some for being too sweet already), and although it tasted decent it was nothing special really, so I can say it was worth but merely to satisfy my curiosity.

Having taken a short rest, we continued our way to [Yoyogi Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyogi_Station), where we caught a metro of the [Ōedo Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toei_%C5%8Cedo_Line) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Toei_Oedo_line_symbol.svg" class="inline"> to [Akabanebashi Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akabanebashi_Station), in Shiba.

#### Shiba

[Minato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minato,_Tokyo) (港, 'harbor') is a special ward of Tokyo, corresponding to the original commercial centre of Edo/Tokyo. Many important companies are headquartered there, aside from several embassies and consulates, as well as an important part of the huge [Port of Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Tokyo). Minato has recently seen a very rapid development, mostly due to the massive projects undertaken in the current century in the ward, including several kinds of infrastructure but most importantly residential towers and skyscrapers.

[Shiba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba,_Tokyo) is one of the five administrative areas of [Minato ward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minato,_Tokyo), and is mostly known for its tall skyscrapers and the [Shiba Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Park).

We left [Akabanebashi Station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akabanebashi_Station) through the north, and continued to the east, up to Akabane Bridge (or *Akabane-Bashi* in Romaji), where we had our first sight of the iconic [Tokyo Tower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower). In old times it was topped by television and radio broadcast antennas, but given most surrounding buildings are now at least as tall as the tower it was mostly repurposed as an observatory. It is built in an Eiffel Tower-like lattice style, and painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.

We then kept going east, and entered the [Shiba Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Park) from the south. This park was built around the [Zōjō-ji temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C5%8Dj%C5%8D-ji), and it is a popular place among locals and tourists for its great views over the temple and Tokyo Tower. It is also a commonplace in advertisements and movies, but it particularly struck me when I saw [Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0) as it is one of the areas where the series takes place.

</div>

The [Zōjō-ji temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C5%8Dj%C5%8D-ji) is a large Buddhist temple. It has existed since 1393, but it has suffered major changes since then, as it was relocated and more buildings were added to it. The temple was particularly important because it was the [Tokugawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_family)'s family temple. Six of the 15 [Tokugawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_family) shoguns are buried in Zōjō-ji, and an important part of the temple was the [Taikoku-in Mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taitoku-in_Mausoleum). It was destroyed by air raids during WW2, but the shoguns' remains were buried so deep they were not affected. Nowadays a smaller mausoleum stands instead.

After a quite long metro trip, we decided to have a quick look around the perimeter of the park, and then took a sit to have some rest and appretiate the view as the Tokyo Tower started to light up.

As we were walking by the northern part of the temple, we noticed these small statues, all lined up. As it turns out the temple also serves as a cemetery, and these small statues (also known as [Jizō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiz%C5%8D) statues) represent unborn children. Grieving parents can choose a statue, decorate it with clothing and toys, and have some sort of gift for [Jizō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiz%C5%8D) (the Buddhist god responsible for coordinating souls in the [six worlds of the desire realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_realm)) and a small pile of pebbles. This is because there is a belief that all children go to "Hell" when they die, so they must build little towers of pebbles for penance before going to another *world*; demons regularly topple these towers, so praying to [Jizō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiz%C5%8D) will have the god protect that child, and pilling pebbles (while performing a heart-felt prayer for each pebble) will help the child get through the torment faster.

At the time all the statues had pinwheels. The considerable wind made them rapidly turn, not too fast so it was not too agitated, but not too slow for it muffled all the noise of the surrounding metropolis. A moment of relative calm, and truly one of those sights that hits you in the feels.

We left the temple grounds through a side gate, and went around the perimeter of the temple until the *Sangedatsumon*. It is especially impressive it is one of the only two structures of the [Zōjō-ji temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C5%8Dj%C5%8D-ji) that survived the air raids, thus making this gate the oldest surviving wooden structure in Tokyo. The *Sangedatsumon* (三解脱門, 'Gate of the Three Liberations') is the most important gate (and usually the main gate) of a Japanese Zen Buddhist temple; it is so-called because, upon passing under it, a person can free himself from three passions: "greed", "hatred" and "foolishness".

We went up the street in front of the *Sangedatsumon* to find our last visit point in Shiba: the [World Trade Center Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(Tokyo)), a 40-story commercial building topped by an observation floor. The tickets costed us ¥620 each, so it was definitely worth for the incredible views at night (although it was better before the neighbouring Nippon Life Hamamatsucho Crea Tower was built to the west). We were there for almost an hour.

We then entered [Hamamatsuchō Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamamatsuch%C5%8D_Station), and took the [Yamanote Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/JR_JY_line_symbol.svg" class="inline"> to [Shibuya Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Station) for our last destination.

#### Shibuya

[Shibuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya) is a special ward of Tokyo, and a major commercial and business centre (if not even the business heart of Tokyo). Particularly, the Shibuya district (small area surrounding [Shibuya Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Station)) is known as a fashion centre of Japan for young people.

As we arrived at [Shibuya Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Station), I was just amazed at how tall and densely packed buildings were in that area, as well as the sea of people in Hachikō Square (just in front of the station). It is named after Hachikō (1923-1935), a Japanese [Akita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_Inu) dog, adopted by agricultural scientist [Hidesaburō Ueno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidesabur%C5%8D_Ueno), which loyally awaited his owner everyday after work at [Shibuya Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Station); after his owner's death in 1925 at work, Hachikō kept waiting everyday by the station for his owner's return until his own death in 1935, earning this good boy the respect of the Japanese as a symbol of loyalty and fidelity.

As we were in Shibuya we could not miss the [Shibuya Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Crossing), the most well-known Japanese scramble crossing. We crossed it twice just for the sake of being able to say we crossed it 🙂.

As it was getting a bit late, we called it a day and got ourselves on our way home.
