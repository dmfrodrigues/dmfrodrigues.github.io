## The trip

On both flights we flew on [Japan Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines) <img class="inline" src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Japan_Airlines_JAL_logo.png"> operated by [Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia_(airline)) <img class="inline" src="https://logosandtypes.com/wp-content/uploads/iberia.svg">.

We left [Lisbon, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Airport) on the 31 August at 06:50 (GMT+01) and flew a short 1h20min flight to [Madrid-Barajas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_Su%C3%A1rez_Madrid%E2%80%93Barajas_Airport), having landed at 09:10 (GMT+02). After lunch (13:05 GMT+02), we took a 13h20min , overnight flight to [Narita International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita_International_Airport), where we arrived at 09:25 (GTM+09) of Sep 1. I couldn't sleep during that flight, partly because of the excitement, the fear of not being able to sleep, and the freezing temperature usual to long-range flights during the night.

Just before landing we were handed the usual customs declaration. Oddly enough, the only time I saw the ocean in Japan was as we were landing in [Narita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita,_Chiba). We landed in [Narita Int'l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita_International_Airport) before lunchtime, and met our guide Yukine (or otherwise Yu-san), which was going to help us out during our stay, mostly by monitoring us, assuring we were on schedule and translate things for us.

### On our way to Tsukuba

#### The climate

Luckily our flight had the right to an airport sleeve, so we had little idea on what we were about to face. As soon as we went through the airport doors, we were met with a suffocating tropical climate: 29°C but most importantly the humidity close to saturation levels (93%) and almost no wind (6 km/h). And so we waited for a charter bus to pick us up for about 15min that seemed like an eternity, under the blazing sun, very tired and clearly unprepared in terms of clothing or spirit. Eventually the weather became a bit more cloudy but similarly hot and humid.

#### The landscape

As we were (finally) picked up at the airport, we took the [Ken-Ō Expressway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken-%C5%8C_Expressway) <img class="inline" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/C4_Expressway_%28Japan%29.png/68px-C4_Expressway_%28Japan%29.png"> to Tsukuba (curiously enough, there was a considerable length of that expressway with only one lane in each way), so we drove for about an hour through the Japanese countryside. And to be honest, it was unparalleled to anything I had ever seen in my life, particularly for an European used to reasonably small trees prepared for harsh European winters: the tall and leafy trees making up dense forests, intertwined with vast fields (assumed to be rice; some green, and some brown-ish) and long canals, and occasionally some agricultural buildings, two-story houses and warehouses. Although it was such a simple view, just reflecting on the uniqueness of this country I had arrived to a couple hours before, and considering the average countryside and landscape was so simple yet beautiful, it almost made me shed a tear in happiness and wonder how much Japan would amaze me.

#### The religion: a first impression

From behind the forest, a statue appears in the distance: a huge standing Buddha (also known as [大仏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daibutsu), *Daibutsu*, 'giant Buddha'). I later came to know it was the [Ushiku Daibutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushiku_Daibutsu), the highest statue in Japan and 4th highest statue in the world as of 2018, made out of bronze in the 1990s.
