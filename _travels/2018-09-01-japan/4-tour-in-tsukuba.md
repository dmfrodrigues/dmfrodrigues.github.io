## Tour in Tsukuba

As usual, the two competition days are separated by a full day of not too exausting activities, so contestants can have the calm environment needed to take a rest and think of how much they screwed up in the first competition day.

### Warp Station Edo

In the morning we started by visiting [Warp Station Edo](https://en.japantravel.com/ibaraki/warp-station-edo/16311), in [Tsukubamirai city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukubamirai,_Ibaraki), some 16km south of [Tsukuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba,_Ibaraki) city center. It is a permanent movie set for 17th century ([Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period)) dramas and films, owned and run by national boardcaster [NHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK). It features a set of Edo period scenarios, including a castle and several adjacent streets.

#### Traditional houses

A traditional Japanese house structure is almost completely made of wood, supporting a tilted roof with large [eaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaves) (hanging edges of the roof) and generally made of dark [roof tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_tiles). Walls were traditionally made of woven bamboo leaves, but they can also be made out of paper, and more recently plywood.

A traditional Japanese house does not have a designated use for each room aside from the entrance area, kitchen, bathroom and toilet, which require proper facilities (some of these would often be communal, such as [sentō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sent%C5%8D)), since all furniture is highly portable and easily storable in large closets spread through the house, and the walls are highly movable.

The kitchen and bathroom floors were usually made of wood, but all other partitions had their floors covered in [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami) mats. The fact tatami mats are softer and comfier than wood floors may suggest why most people slept in [futons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futon) laid on top of tatami (according to a recent survey, about half of the Japanese still sleep in futons instead of beds).

But there was something a little off: the elaborate roofs were clearly a lot heavier than the rest of the structure, which does not make much sense in Japan given earthquakes and strong winds are frequent. Even the Greek only used roof tiles in buildings made of rock, because it was obvious a wooden building built with archaic techniques could not stand heavy roofs. So Yu-san told us that in weak earthquakes the heavy roof helped stabilize the house, and in the case of a major earthquake the roof tiles were designed so they'd slide down the roof into the ground, so if the roof was to fall it would only have its skeleton falling into people.

It did seem to make sense at first, but to tell the whole story one must mention some very important motivations for such architecture:
- Wood was promply available pretty much everywhere, as was bamboo, rice and rush to make all the components of a traditional Japanese house;
- Wood and paper are light, so even a small house could fit varying purposes as wooden walls are easy to remove. Also, it was easy to relocate the house itself, as only the roof tiles had to be left behind (but could be easily made), and the rest was just portable furniture, wooden beams, flooring and walls made in standard sizes;
- Rock was difficult to transport and only the rich could afford houses made of rock (most castles are made of rock, not only because they are more effective defensively, but also because only the rich could afford rock buildings).
- Because most people couldn't afford houses made of rock, they'd often prefer a decent wooden house, even if it implied risking crushing during an earthquake or typhoon.

Of course, given most people now had wooden houses, they'd do their best to make them evolve into the most disaster-resistant structures possible.

### Geological Museum

After lunch we headed to the [Geological Museum](https://www.gsj.jp/Muse/en/), opened in 1980 to introduce visitors to the [Geological Survey of Japan](https://www.gsj.jp/en/) (GSJ) and host many artifacts that resulted from the activities of GSJ. It was quite interesting although it was nothing particularly surprising: it had some fossiles, cristals, and some gold nuggets and small diamonds.

### Science Square

We then went a short distance to [Science Square Tsukuba](https://www.aist.go.jp/sst/en/), a small (but very insightful) show of cutting-edge Japanese industrial technology. One of the items I would like to highlight is the replica of the perfect, single-crystal 1kg silicon sphere that has been used in the [recent redefinition of SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units) (most importantly the kilogram and the mole, impacted by the definition of the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant)), which for any physicist like myself (although I latter diverged into informatics) is the most important global effort into improving science in recent years, and the most important advance in metrology of the century.

### Tsukuba Space Center

[JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) is the Japanese national aerospace and space agency. It has been important in supplying the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), and advancing and developing domestic aerospatial technology (including 100% Japan-made rockets and satellites).

The [Tsukuba Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Space_Center) is the headquarters of JAXA. This is where Japanese astronauts are trained, and where most space research and engineering is focused (meaning this is also where the JAXA satellites, rockets and the [Kibō ISS module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kib%C5%8D_(ISS_module)) are assembled). This was probably the most fascinating place we visited the whole day.

On the outside there is a real-scale model of the [H-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II) rocket, one of the greatest JAXA achievements as the first rocket completely made with Japanese technology, capable of delivering heavy satellites. More specifically, it is a Ground Test Vehicle, so it was supposedly fully functional at some point.

We visited the Exhibition Hall, which is the Tsukuba Space Center visitors venue by excellence, showcasing the most important (and impressive) parts of the work developed by JAXA and the organizations that preceded it.

Here are some of the satellites that are part of Japanese space development:
- [ETS-III](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ets-3.htm) (also called *Kiku-4*), was an early satellite used to test instrumentation and fundamental equipments such as solar array deployment, attitude and thermal control.
- [ETS-VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS-VII) (also called *Kiku-7*), was used as a test to a range of Japanese robotics space technology, which included the first robotic arm in a spacecraft. It was launched in 1997 and decomissioned in 1999.
- [ETS-VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS-VIII) (also called *Kiku-8*), a communications satellite, launched in 2007 and deactivated in 2017, operated at [GEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit) orbit. Its deployable antenna was the size of a tennis court, making it the largest geostationary satellite in the world.

We also saw the [SELENE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELENE) (also known as *Kaguya*), a lunar orbiter launched in 2007 and decomissioned in 2009 after it was intentionally crashed into the Moon. Its distinctive feature is its black color, unusual for spacecraft which are usually either white (as a standard color) or gold (because they are covered in gold leaf, which is highly reflective).

#### Quasi-Zenith Satellite System

Although the Exhibition Hall did not include it, it is worth mentioning that Japan is planning its own alternative to the GPS system. It's called [Quasi-Zenith Satellite System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Zenith_Satellite_System), and it is currently made of four (planned to be seven when it is complete) satellites overflying Japan, one in geostationary orbit and three in highly elliptical geosynchronous orbits to guarantee complete coverage of all parts of Japan at all time. This means that, everywhere in Japan and at all time, there is always one satellite almost directly above (or otherwize *quasi-zenith*).

Since their signals are compatible with GPS, it is mostly used in complement with existing GPS and other compatible satellites to greatly increase precision in Japan's numerous [urban canyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_canyon), which require very high-altitude satellites overflying the devices almost directly above it. It will eventually be able to operate in a completely standalone way if needed, which means Japan will no longer depend on foreign powers to have precise geolocation.
