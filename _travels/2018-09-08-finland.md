[Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) (*Suomi*) is a [nordic country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_country) in northern Europe. It is home to about 5.5M people, being the most sparcely populated country in Europe, mostly owned to the fact it includes vast areas near the [arctic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle). It is divided into 19 regions, where each region is made of several municipalities. Finland shares borders with [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) and [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) to the north (in [Lapland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapland_(Finland))), and in the east and southeast with [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) (with which Finland has historically and regularly had political, cultural and border conflicts).

Until the 1950s it was mostly an agragian country, after which it rapidly industrialized into a very developed economy and implemented a comprehensive nordic welfare system, leading Finland to be a top performer in numerous development indexes in terms of education, competitiveness and quality of life. Finnish economic growth in the late 1990s was mostly fueled by [Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia), which represented 80% of the market capitalization of the [Helsinki Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Stock_Exchange).

Most people in Finland are Christians, where 68.7% are affiliated to the [Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_of_Finland), 1.1% to the [Orthodox Church of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church_of_Finland), 1.7% to other faiths and 28.5% unaffiliated. The [Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_of_Finland) and the [Orthodox Church of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church_of_Finland) have special status as [national churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_church) (not as [state churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_state), as Finland has undergone a thorough secularization process), the first because it is the native church of Finland, and the second because of the past status of Finland as a part of Russia (in a time where Finland also included many areas of Karelia, which were heavily Orthodox much like the rest of Russia).

### Government

Finland is a [semi-presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system) republic, where the head of state is the [President of the Republic of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Finland), the head of cabinet is the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Finland) and supreme legislative authority rests in the [Parliament of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland), a unicameral parliament with 200 members.

As of 2018 it was governed by [Juha Sipilä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juha_Sipil%C3%A4) of the [Centre Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Party_(Finland)), supported by the center-right conservatives of the [National Coalition Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_Party) and the right-wing populists of [Finns Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns_Party). After the [2019 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Finnish_parliamentary_election), a new government was formed, led by [Antii Rinne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antti_Rinne) of the [Social Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Finland) and supported by the [Centre Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Party_(Finland)), the [Greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_League), the socialists of the [Left Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Alliance_(Finland)) and the [Swedish People's Party of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_People%27s_Party_of_Finland) (a small centre party supporting Swedish minorities' rights in Finland).

### Language

The main language in Finland is [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language), an [Uralic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages), which means it is unrelated to the [Scandinavian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages) (which are [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages)), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) (which is a [Slavic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages)) or any other language in Europe aside from [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language). [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language) is also an official language, given the historical connection between Finland and Sweden. [Sámi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_languages) is a recognized language of Finland, spoken in the northernmost parts of Scandinavia by the [Sámi people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people); it is also an [Uralic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages).

### History

Finland was initially inhabited by Finnish and Uralic tribes until the Swedish Crusades (as part of the [Northern Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Crusades) against the pagan tribes and peoples), at which time it came under Swedish rule in the 13th century. After the [Russo-Swedish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Swedish_War_(1788%E2%80%931790)) (1788-1790), the Finnish elite realised its precarious position between Sweden and Russia which were permanently at conflict, and its connection with Sweden, were becoming too costly for the Finnish, thus heightening Finnish independence movements. These didn't last long as Finland was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1809 after the [Finnish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_War) (between Russia and Sweden, obviously), remaining with relative independence as the newly-formed [Grand Duchy of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland).

Following the [February Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution) (a first, democratic revolution in Russia), politics in Finland started to organize into two blocks: a left-wing block that controlled the Finnish parliament and was in favour of independence, and a right-wing block demanding the Finnish parliament dissolution in favour of the provisional Russian government. As new elections were held, the right-wing block won the parliament; in the meanwhile, the bolsheviks led the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution) in Russia, and declared all "Russian peoples" had the right to self-determination, a chance the right-wing in Finland took to pass the [Finnish Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Declaration_of_Independence) in parliament, in December 1917. The independence was followed by a civil war, which saw the *Whites* (right-wing supported by the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire)) win over the *Reds* (left-wing supported by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union)). In WW2, Finland allied with the Germans as a way to maintain independence from the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), as well as to take some advantage from the German military might to fuel Finnish ambitions over [Karelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia) and the [Kola Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula). By the end of WW2, Finland remained independent, although the Soviet Union enforced a series of conditions, restrictions and reparations. Given its recent history, Finland determined it would be a neutral country between the West and the Soviets, at the same time having the Soviet Union as its greatest trade partner but keeping a market economy. When the Soviet Union fell, Finland swiftly integrated with the West, having joined [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) in 1994, the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) in 1995 and the [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone) in 1999 as a founding member.

## Cities

### Helsinki

[Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki) (or *Helsingfors* in [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language)) is the capital and largest city of Finland. So large indeed that it has 1.5M people living in its metropolitan area. The region has been inhabited since the Iron Age, but it was first established as a town in 1550 by [King Gustav I of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_I_of_Sweden). It became the capital of Finland in 1812, to reduce Swedish influence exerted from the old capital [Turku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turku). Its location close to the southern border of Finland with Russia made it a particular target for Russia during its many incursions into Finland.

It is a particularly interesting city, because it has a quite low population density when compared to other European cities, probably owned to the fact its growth happened in recent times. It is the northernmost capital in the world, only after [Reykjavík](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk). It is located in the region of [Uusima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uusimaa), on the northern coast of the [Gulf of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Finland).

# Why

Me, three more colleagues and two teachers had just attended the [International Olympiad in Informatics 2020, in Japan from 1 to 8 Sep]({{ site.baseurl }}/travels/2018-sep-japan/), and as our travel from [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) to [Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon) implied stopping in Helsinki for 4h30min we decided to explore the city.

# The trip

We arrived at [Helsinki Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Airport) at 13:50 (GMT+03:00), and took the TODO:?? line to [Helsinki Central Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Central_Station), in [Vironniemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vironniemi) district, the heart of downtown Helsinki. The weather was mild and sunny, around 20-25°C and with a slight breeze.

We hadn't had lunch yet, so we headed rather quickly to the [Market Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square,_Helsinki) (*Kauppatori*), where we already knew there was going to be food.

</div>

The Market Square is on the north part of the [South Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Harbour,_Helsinki), located in a small bay. The South Harbour is one of the most important in Finland, being a stop for over 4.7M people and over a million tonnes of [containerized cargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization) each year, and an important hub for islanders living off the coast of Helsinki.

I bought a hotdog at the Market Square, and hurried to eat it as seagulls are a known threat to food anywhere near the harbour.

In the background, the majestic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Cathedral">Helsinki Cathedral</a>.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

With our stomachs filled, we were then travelling mostly on sight, as we had not exactly prepared a tour through Helsinki. As we could spot it from the [Allas Sea Pool](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allas_Sea_Pool) building, and because it was closer, we started by visiting the [Uspenski Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uspenski_Cathedral).

When Helsinki was made the capital of Finland in 1812, the [Tsar Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia) decreed that salt taxes were to be collected to fund two large churches to be built in the city, one Lutheran and one Orthodox. The Orthodox church is the [Uspenski Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uspenski_Cathedral), and the Lutheran church is the [Helsinki Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Cathedral).

[Uspenski Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uspenski_Cathedral) is the main cathedral of the [Orthodox Church of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church_of_Finland), and was built in 1862-1868 with about 700,000 bricks brought over in barges from the demolished Bomarsund Fortress after the [Battle of Bomarsund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomarsund_Fortress) (part of the [Crimean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War)).

The church truly is magnificent, particularly when seen from up close. But make no mistake: it may look very large when seen from a distance, but a walk around it clarifies that the cathedral is clearly a lot smaller than it looks.

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

With pure tourist blood in our veins, we just went all in into the cathedral, cameras in hand. We entered through a side door, and were quite surprised we were blocked from entering the [nave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave); only then we noticed there was some sort of ["divine service"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Service_(Eastern_Orthodoxy)) taking place, with a sign in English clearly stating "No sightseeing" (we still did sightseeing).

We then crossed a bridge over a canal, and took [Alexander Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksanterinkatu) (*Aleksanterinkatu*) to find some of the most important landmarks in Helsinki.

This is the place where new nobility members were "introduced" to their peers. It served as an official representation of the Finnish nobility before the government, although it now serves only the few purposes of registering current members of the nobility (even though they have no privileges) and their geneology.

As a curiosity, the [Helsinki Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Cathedral) is heavily featured in the videoclip of song [*Sandstorm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU) by Finnish DJ [Darude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darude), one of the first hits in the genre of [electronic dance music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music).

As we were just about to run out of time (so we could catch a metro back to the airport and make it to the gate with a decent safety margin), we headed back to the train station to catch the TODO:?? line back to [Helsinki Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Airport).

## Notes

### Music

Finland, much like the Scandinavian countries, is addicted to metal. Especially Finland, because it it a true breeding ground for metal bands (it is the most metal country in Europe, with [70 metal bands per 100,000 people](https://medium.com/@r2000.gp/why-finns-have-an-affinity-with-metal-music-2425b0045716)), and because you can hear metal on commercial radio (!).

As obvious, here are some of my favourite bands and tracks from Finland.
